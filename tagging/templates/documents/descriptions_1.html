<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">   To protect
multitiered web services, Intrusion detection systems have been
widely used to detect known attacks by matching misused traffic
patterns or signatures the web IDS and the database IDS can detect
abnormal network traffic sent to either of them. However, we found
that these IDSs cannot detect cases wherein normal traffic is used to
attack the webserver and the database server. For example, if an
attacker with nonadmin privileges can log in to a webserver using
normal-user access credentials, he/she can find a way to issue a
privileged database query by exploiting vulnerabilities in the
webserver. Neither the web IDS nor the database IDS would detect this
type of attack since the web IDS would merely see typical user login
traffic and the database IDS would see only the normal traffic of a
privileged user. This type of attack can be readily detected if the
database IDS can identify that a privileged request from the
webserver is not associated with

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"> Eventhough we
have to protect both front end and back end (database).So, We are
implementing DoubleGuard . Which can detect SQL injection attacks by
taking the structures of web requests and database queries without
looking into the values of input parameters (i.e., no input
validation at the websever).We presented an intrusion detection
system that builds models of normal behavior for multitiered web
applications from both front-end web (HTTP) requests and back-end
database (SQL) queries. Unlike previous approaches that correlated or
summarized alerts generated by independent IDSs . DoubleGuard was
able to identify a wide range of attacks with minimal false

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">In  IDs, We are
collecting logs (data) and analyze the different type of attack.Which
match with the pattern of popularknown attacks,analyses them
statistically and report back to the administrator.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">But, IDS not able
to monitor and analyze all traffic on large busy network and also
which is not suited for encrypted data or not suitable for encrpted
traffic . Which will  create duplicate log files.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">But using honey
pots we can get log file details and also attackers details. Which
will provide less amount of logs. We can avoid duplicate logs or
repeated logs.Here we are impletening honeypot in firewall. It work
in reverse direction of firewall and also it is tool to learn about
tactics of hackers.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">Which is suitable
in  bluck traffic environment.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><FONT SIZE=4>This
paper describes about providing security in web application.  Every
organization  uses web application for accesing data from the
database. So the organizations are aware of data security. the
attacker uses different technique  such as SQL injection, client side
Cross site scripting ,Hijack future session for corrupting data.</FONT></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal"><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">  <FONT SIZE=4>Most
of the attacks are done by inserting malicious query as a input
through web request. In this paper they intoduce Intrusion
System.(Based on user input query) Honeypot (To reuduce the false
alaram).By monitoring web request and database query, We can identify
the attack(which are not identify by IDS)</FONT></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">In this paper we
are implementing both honeypot and IDS to secure the web application.
Sensors are used in both front-end and back-end. The main purpose of 
IDS and Honeypot to protect the database. Using honeypot we are
collecting log files.which are stored in separate database.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: normal">When the attack is
occurs, IDs will detect the attack which has been happen eariler
using log file stored in  database. So, we can avoid the duplicate
alerts.which are well suited in muti-tier environment and also we can
get encrypted details by honeypots.</P>
